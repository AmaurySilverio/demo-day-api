Rough Draft for ASL translation app with live translation capabilities. Check back in for weekly updates.

## How It's Made:
**Tech Used**: HTML, CSS, JS, Nodes.js, Express, MongoDB

## Current Status:

This week I did the starter API and some light styling for my demo day project. I want to add user authentication and more information to the database. Right now, I see the that the search feature is being underutilized and only showing the user a letter that they search. I want to add words and phrases this search feature as well. I also have a nav bar with a few other pages I need to create. I created a very simple landing page for the live translation page. However, it is not linked correctly and not populating the dom. 

I am still figuring out the exact color palette and layout for this application. Everything you see is subject to change as I continue to build this project out.

## Installation

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`

## Usage

1. run `npm run aslStart`
2. Navigate to `localhost:3000`
